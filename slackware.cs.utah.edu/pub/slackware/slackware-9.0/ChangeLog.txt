patches/packages/bind-9.7.6_P1-i386-1_slack9.0.tgz:  Upgraded.
  This release fixes an issue that could crash BIND, leading to a denial of
  service.  It also fixes the so-called "ghost names attack" whereby a
  remote attacker may trigger continued resolvability of revoked domain names.
  For more information, see:
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-1033
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-1667
  IMPORTANT NOTE:  This is a upgraded version of BIND, _not_ a patched one.
  It is likely to be more strict about the correctness of configuration files.
  Care should be taken about deploying this upgrade on production servers to
  avoid an unintended interruption of service.

patches/packages/bind-9.4_ESV_R5-i386-1_slack9.0.tgz:  Upgraded.
  This BIND update addresses a couple of security issues:
  * named, set up to be a caching resolver, is vulnerable to a user
    querying a domain with very large resource record sets (RRSets)
    when trying to negatively cache the response. Due to an off-by-one
    error, caching the response could cause named to crash. [RT #24650]
    [CVE-2011-1910]
  * Change #2912 (see CHANGES) exposed a latent bug in the DNS message
    processing code that could allow certain UPDATE requests to crash
    named. [RT #24777] [CVE-2011-2464]

     * A large RRSET from a remote authoritative server that results in
       the recursive resolver trying to negatively cache the response can
       hit an off by one code error in named, resulting in named crashing.
       [RT #24650] [CVE-2011-1910]

patches/packages/bind-9.3.5_P1-i386-1_slack9.0.tgz:
  Upgraded to bind-9.3.5-P1.
  This upgrade addresses a security flaw known as the CERT VU#800113 DNS Cache
  Poisoning Issue.  This is the summary of the problem from the BIND site:
    "A weakness in the DNS protocol may enable the poisoning of caching
     recurive resolvers with spoofed data.  DNSSEC is the only full solution.
     New versions of BIND provide increased resilience to the attack."
  It is suggested that sites that run BIND upgrade to one of the new packages
  in order to reduce their exposure to DNS cache poisoning attacks.

patches/packages/libpng-1.2.27-i386-1_slack9.0.tgz:
  Upgraded to libpng-1.2.27.
  This fixes various bugs, the most important of which have to do with the
  handling of unknown chunks containing zero-length data.  Processing a PNG
  image that contains these could cause the application using libpng to crash
  (possibly resulting in a denial of service), could potentially expose the
  contents of uninitialized memory, or could cause the execution of arbitrary
  code as the user running libpng (though it would probably be quite difficult
  to cause the execution of attacker-chosen code).  We recommend upgrading the
  package as soon as possible.

  In addition to bugfixes and enhancements, this version of m4 also fixes two
  issues with possible security implications.  A minor security fix with the
  use of "maketemp" and "mkstemp" -- these are now quoted to prevent the
  (rather unlikely) possibility that an unquoted string could match an
  existing macro causing operations to be done on the wrong file.  Also,
  a problem with the '-F' option (introduced with version 1.4) could cause a
  core dump or possibly (with certain file names) the execution of arbitrary
  code.  For more information on these issues, see:

  From the OpenSSH release notes:
  "Security bugs resolved in this release:  Prevent ssh(1) from using a
  trusted X11 cookie if creation of an untrusted cookie fails; found and
  fixed by Jan Pechanec."
  While it's fair to say that we here at Slackware don't see how this could
  be leveraged to compromise a system, a) the OpenSSH people (who presumably
  understand the code better) characterize this as a security bug, b) it has
  been assigned a CVE entry, and c) OpenSSH is one of the most commonly used
  network daemons.  Better safe than sorry.

patches/packages/bind-9.2.6_P2-i386-1_slack9.0.tgz:
  Upgraded to bind-9.2.6-P2.  This fixes some security issues related to
  previous fixes in OpenSSL.  The minimum OpenSSL version was raised to
  OpenSSL 0.9.7l and OpenSSL 0.9.8d to avoid exposure to known security flaws
  in older versions (these patches were already issued for Slackware).  If you
  have not upgraded yet, get those as well to prevent a potentially exploitable
  security problem in named.  In addition, the default RSA exponent was changed
  from 3 to 65537.  RSA keys using exponent 3 (which was previously BIND's
  default) will need to be regenerated to protect against the forging
  of RRSIGs.

  (* Security fix *)
patches/packages/openssh-4.4p1-i386-1_slack9.0.tgz:
  Upgraded to openssh-4.4p1.
  This fixes a few security related issues.  From the release notes found at
  http://www.openssh.com/txt/release-4.4:
    * Fix a pre-authentication denial of service found by Tavis Ormandy,
      that would cause sshd(8) to spin until the login grace time
      expired.
    * Fix an unsafe signal hander reported by Mark Dowd. The signal
      handler was vulnerable to a race condition that could be exploited
      to perform a pre-authentication denial of service. On portable
      OpenSSH, this vulnerability could theoretically lead to
      pre-authentication remote code execution if GSSAPI authentication
      is enabled, but the likelihood of successful exploitation appears
      remote.
    * On portable OpenSSH, fix a GSSAPI authentication abort that could
      be used to determine the validity of usernames on some platforms.

    After this upgrade, make sure the permissions on /etc/rc.d/rc.sshd are set
  the way you want them.  Future upgrades will respect the existing permissions
  settings.  Thanks to Manuel Reimer for pointing out that upgrading openssh
  would enable a previously disabled sshd daemon.
    Do better checking of passwd, shadow, and group to avoid adding
    redundant entries to these files.  Thanks to Menno Duursma.

patches/packages/openssl-0.9.7l-i386-1_slack9.0.tgz:
  Upgraded to openssl-0.9.7l.
  This fixes a few security related issues:
      During the parsing of certain invalid ASN.1 structures an error
    condition is mishandled.  This can result in an infinite loop which
    consumes system memory (CVE-2006-2937).  (This issue did not affect
    OpenSSL versions prior to 0.9.7)
    Thanks to Dr S. N. Henson of Open Network Security and NISCC.
      Certain types of public key can take disproportionate amounts of
    time to process. This could be used by an attacker in a denial of
    service attack (CVE-2006-2940).
    Thanks to Dr S. N. Henson of Open Network Security and NISCC.
      A buffer overflow was discovered in the SSL_get_shared_ciphers()
    utility function.  An attacker could send a list of ciphers to an
    application that uses this function and overrun a buffer.
    (CVE-2006-3738)
    Thanks to Tavis Ormandy and Will Drewry of the Google Security Team.
      A flaw in the SSLv2 client code was discovered. When a client
    application used OpenSSL to create an SSLv2 connection to a malicious
    server, that server could cause the client to crash (CVE-2006-4343).
    Thanks to Tavis Ormandy and Will Drewry of the Google Security Team.

  Upgraded to sendmail-8.13.7.
  Fixes a potential denial of service problem caused by excessive recursion
  leading to stack exhaustion when attempting delivery of a malformed MIME
  message.  This crashes sendmail's queue processing daemon, which in turn
  can lead to two problems:  depending on the settings, these crashed
  processes may create coredumps which could fill a drive partition; and
  such a malformed message in the queue will cause queue processing to
  cease when the message is reached, causing messages that are later in
  the queue to not be processed.

patches/packages/sendmail-8.13.6-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to sendmail-8.13.6.
  This new version of sendmail contains a fix for a security problem
  discovered by Mark Dowd of ISS X-Force.  From sendmail's advisory:
    Sendmail was notified by security researchers at ISS that, under some
    specific timing conditions, this vulnerability may permit a specifically
    crafted attack to take over the sendmail MTA process, allowing remote
    attackers to execute commands and run arbitrary programs on the system
    running the MTA, affecting email delivery, or tampering with other
    programs and data on this system.  Sendmail is not aware of any public
    exploit code for this vulnerability.  This connection-oriented
    vulnerability does not occur in the normal course of sending and
    receiving email.  It is only triggered when specific conditions are
    created through SMTP connection layer commands.
  Sendmail's complete advisory may be found here:
    http://www.sendmail.com/company/advisory/index.shtml
  The CVE entry for this issue may be found here:

patches/packages/gnupg-1.4.2.2-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to gnupg-1.4.2.2.
  There have been two security related issues reported recently with GnuPG.
  From the GnuPG 1.4.2.1 and 1.4.2.2 NEWS files:
    Noteworthy changes in version 1.4.2.2 (2006-03-08)
    * Files containing several signed messages are not allowed any
      longer as there is no clean way to report the status of such
      files back to the caller.  To partly revert to the old behaviour
      the new option --allow-multisig-verification may be used.
   Noteworthy changes in version 1.4.2.1 (2006-02-14)
    * Security fix for a verification weakness in gpgv.  Some input
      could lead to gpgv exiting with 0 even if the detached signature
      file did not carry any signature.  This is not as fatal as it
      might seem because the suggestion as always been not to rely on
      th exit code but to parse the --status-fd messages.  However it
      is likely that gpgv is used in that simplified way and thus we
      do this release.  Same problem with "gpg --verify" but nobody
      should have used this for signature verification without
      checking the status codes anyway.  Thanks to the taviso from
      Gentoo for reporting this problem.

  Fixes this minor security bug:  "If a request contains both Transfer-Encoding
  and Content-Length headers, remove the Content-Length, mitigating some HTTP
  Request Splitting/Spoofing attacks."
  (* Security fix *)
patches/packages/imapd-4.64-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to imapd-4.64.
  A buffer overflow was reported in the mail_valid_net_parse_work function.
  However, this function in the c-client library does not appear to be called
  from anywhere in imapd.  iDefense states that the issue is of LOW risk to
  sites that allow users shell access, and LOW-MODERATE risk to other servers.
  I believe it's possible that it is of NIL risk if the function is indeed
  dead code to imapd, but draw your own conclusions...
  (* Security fix *)
patches/packages/lynx-2.8.5rel.5-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to lynx-2.8.5rel.5.
  Fixes an issue where the handling of Asian characters when using lynx to

  overflow causing the execution of arbitrary code.

patches/packages/util-linux-2.11z-i386-2.tgz:  Patched an issue with
  umount where if the umount failed when the '-r' option was used, the
  filesystem would be remounted read-only but without any extra flags
  specified in /etc/fstab.  This could allow an ordinary user able to
  mount a floppy or CD (but with nosuid, noexec, nodev, etc in

patches/packages/pcre-6.3-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to pcre-6.3.
  This fixes a buffer overflow that could be triggered by the processing of a
  specially crafted regular expression.  Theoretically this could be a security
  issue if regular expressions are accepted from untrusted users to be
  processed by a user with greater privileges, but this doesn't seem like a
  common scenario (or, for that matter, a good idea).  However, if you are
  using an application that links to the shared PCRE library and accepts
  outside input in such a manner, you will want to update to this new package.

    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2491
  (* Security fix *)
patches/packages/php-4.3.11-i386-4.tgz:  Relinked with the system PCRE library,
  as the builtin library has a buffer overflow that could be triggered by the

patches/packages/infozip-5.52-i486-1.tgz:  Upgraded to unzip552.tar.gz and
  zip231.tar.gz.  These fix some buffer overruns if deep directory paths are
  packed into a Zip archive which could be a security vulnerability (for
  example, in a case of automated archiving or backups that use Zip).  However,
  it also appears that these now use certain assembly instructions that might
  not be available on older CPUs, so if you have an older machine you may wish
  to take this into account before deciding whether you should upgrade.

  This fixes one new security issue (the first issue, CAN-2004-0492, was fixed
  in apache-1.3.32).  The second bug fixed in 1.3.3 (CAN-2004-0940) allows a
  local user who can create SSI documents to become "nobody".  The amount of

patches/packages/rsync-2.6.3-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to rsync-2.6.3.
  From the rsync NEWS file:
      A bug in the sanitize_path routine (which affects a non-chrooted
      rsync daemon) could allow a user to craft a pathname that would get
      transformed into an absolute path for certain options (but not for
      file-transfer names).  If you're running an rsync daemon with chroot
      disabled, *please upgrade*, ESPECIALLY if the user privs you run
      rsync under is anything above "nobody".
  Note that rsync, in daemon mode, sets the "use chroot" to true by
  default, and (in this default mode) is not vulnerable to this issue.
  I would strongly recommend against setting "use chroot" to false
  even if you've upgraded to this new package.

patches/packages/mod_ssl-2.8.19_1.3.31-i386-1.tgz:
  Upgraded to mod_ssl-2.8.19-1.3.31.
  This fixes a security hole (ssl_log() related format string
  vulnerability in mod_proxy hook functions), so sites using mod_ssl

patches/packages/samba-2.2.10-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to samba-2.2.10.
  A buffer overrun has been located in the code used to support
  the 'mangling method = hash' smb.conf option.  Affected Samba
  2.2 installations can avoid this possible security bug by using
  the hash2 mangling method.  Server installations requiring
  the hash mangling method are encouraged to upgrade to Samba v2.2.10
  or v3.0.5.

  previous php packages where linking against the library in a path under
  /tmp caused an ELF rpath to this location to be built into the PHP binaries.
  A local attacker could (by placing shared libraries in this location) either

  These security fixes were backported from Apache 1.3.31:

    In mod_digest, verify whether the nonce returned in the client

    mod_auth_digest. (CAN-2003-0987)

    Escape arbitrary data before writing into the errorlog.  (CAN-2003-0020)

    Fix starvation issue on listening sockets where a short-lived connection
    on a rarely-accessed listening socket will cause a child to hold the
    accept mutex and block out new connections until another connection
    arrives on that rarely-accessed listening socket.  (CAN-2004-0174)

    The KDE team has found a buffer overflow in the file information reader
    of VCF files.  A carefully crafted .VCF file potentially enables local
    attackers to compromise the privacy of a victim's data or execute
    arbitrary commands with the victim's privileges.
      By default, file information reading is disabled for remote files.

  not vulnerable to any of the fixed problems.
  Please indulge me for this brief aside (as requests for PAM are on the rise):
    If you see a security problem reported which depends on PAM, you can be
    glad you run Slackware.  I think a better name for PAM might be SCAM, for
    Swiss Cheese Authentication Modules, and have never felt that the small
    amount of convenience it provides is worth the great loss of system
    security.  We miss out on half a dozen security problems a year by not
    using PAM, but you can always install it yourself if you feel that
    you're missing out on the fun.  (No, don't do that)

    X-Force Research at ISS has discovered a remote exploit in ProFTPD's
    handling of ASCII translations that an attacker, by downloading a
    carefully crafted file, can exploit and gain a root shell.  The source
    distributions on ftp.proftpd.org have all been replaced with patched

    the patched versions as soon as possible.

  Note that the upgraded package does not change the displayed version
  number to 1.2.8p (it remains 1.2.8), but we've verified the source code
  to make sure that this is in fact the patched version.  We recommend all
  sites running ProFTPD upgrade to the new package right away.

  with the 2.4.20 kernel, and add a few extra drivers (like Silicon Image
  Serial-ATA support).  The new kernel also fixes a number of security
  issues, such as a routing cache problem in 2.4.20 and earlier can allow
  an attacker to cause hash collisions in the prerouting chain that consume
  CPU resources resulting in a denial-of-service (CAN-2003-0244).

patches/packages/kde/*:  Upgraded to KDE 3.1.1a.  Also included in
  this directory are a rebuild of Qt (linked with Xft2 rather than
  Xft1), an updated aRts package (the aRts sound server is a
  component of KDE, but ships as part of Slackware's L series), and
  kdevelop-3.0a4a.

  Note that this update addresses a security problem with KDE's
  handling of PostScript documents.  This is the overview of the
  problem from the KDE site:

    KDE uses Ghostscript software for processing of PostScript (PS)
    and PDF files in a way that allows for the execution of arbitrary
    commands that can be contained in such files.

    An attacker can prepare a malicious PostScript or PDF file which will
    provide the attacker with access to the victim's account and privileges
    when the victim opens this malicious file for viewing or when the
    victim browses a directory containing such malicious file and has
    file previews enabled.

    An attacker can provide malicious files remotely to a victim in an
    e-mail, as part of a webpage, via an ftp server and possible other
    means.

We recommend that sites running KDE install this update.

Please note that the change from Xft1 to Xft2 has changed the available
fonts in Konsole (and presumably elsewhere), and that Xft2 seems unable to
display the Linux Console font that was previously Slackware's default.
Also, it doesn't handle gamma correction when displaying fonts against a
black background, so we've had to change the default to black fonts on a
white background (this is Konsole's default).  This creates an additional
issue with certain file types displayed as bold white by /etc/DIR_COLORS
becoming invisible in directory listings.  A workaround is to comment out
these lines (or change to a different color):

.mpg 01;37 # movie formats
.avi 01;37
.mov 01;37

            ****************************************
            * IMPORTANT: Security bugfix for Samba *
            ****************************************

  Digital Defense, Inc. has alerted the Samba Team to a serious
  vulnerability in all stable versions of Samba currently shipping.
  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
  the ID CAN-2003-0201 to this defect.

  This vulnerability, if exploited correctly, leads to an anonymous
  user gaining root access on a Samba serving system. All versions
  of Samba up to and including Samba 2.2.8 are vulnerable. An active
  exploit of the bug has been reported in the wild. Alpha versions of
  Samba 3.0 and above are *NOT* vulnerable.

  Speakup code from CVS.
a/aaa_base-9.0.0-noarch-1.tgz:  Updated initial email.
a/hotplug-2002_08_26-noarch-5.tgz:  Added e100 module to the blacklist so

a/pkgtools-9.0.0-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to dialog-0.9b-20030308.
  Fixed missing xwmconfig manpage (thanks to Mark Post).

Sun Mar  9 23:49:43 PST 2003
Slackware 9.0-rc2 is released for testing.
bootdisks/:  Regenerated bootdisks from new kernels.
rootdisks/install.*, isolinux/initrd.img:  Modified /sbin/probe to handle
  installing to a prepared software RAID array (type Linux RAID autodetect).
  Thanks to Gaston Dassieu Blanchet for the patch.
rootdisks/pcmcia.dsk, network.dsk:  Recompiled kernel modules.
extra/db-4.1.25/db4-4.1.25-i386-1.tgz:  Added db-4.1.25.
extra/iproute2-2.4.7-now-ss020116-try/iproute2-2.4.7_now_ss020116_try-i386-4.tgz:
  Recompiled against the fixed libdb3.
extra/isdn4k-utils/isdn4k-utils-CVS-2003-03-09.tar.gz:  Updated from CVS.
extra/kernel-modules-2.4.20_xfs/kernel-modules-2.4.20_xfs-i486-3.tgz:
  Recompiled, updated DRM modules.  Note that the xfs.i kernel did NOT get the
  ext3 patches because otherwise the XFS patch doesn't apply cleanly.
extra/lilo-22.5/lilo-22.5-i386-2.tgz:  I'm getting reports of problems with this
  version of LILO and RAID, so it's being moved into extra/ for now.
kernels/:  Applied Andrew Morton's ext3 patches.
a/devs-2.3.1-i386-13.tgz:  Added video, radio, vtx, and vbi devices.
  Suggested by Kaloyan Naumov.
a/elflibs-9.0.3-i386-1.tgz:  Updated libdb-3.3.so.
a/etc-5.0-noarch-11.tgz:  In lang.{csh|sh}, suggest using LANG set to
  en_US.ISO8859-1 rather than C if problems are encountered with mouse cut and
  paste with GTK2.  Piter PUNK suggested making en_US.ISO8859-1 the default, but
  this has other side effects such as changing the sorting of directory listings.
a/hotplug-2002_08_26-noarch-4.tgz:  Blacklist non-cardbus SCSI kernel modules,
  as these are likely to be built into the kernel if needed or already loaded
  from an initrd.
a/kernel-ide-2.4.20-i486-3.tgz:  Applied Andrew Morton's ext3 patches.
a/kernel-modules-2.4.20-i486-4.tgz:  Applied Andrew Morton's ext3 patches.
a/lilo-22.4.1-i386-2.tgz:  If no other kernel is found, look for a built kernel
  in /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot.  (suggested by Jan Rafaj)
  In liloconfig's expert mode, added a dialog box to show (and possibly edit)
  the detected location of the MBR.  This is helpful when installing to RAID
  volumes or other devices that might not be autodetected properly.
  Reverted to lilo-22.4.1 (for now) due to reported RAID problems with 22.5.
a/shadow-4.0.3-i386-6.tgz:  Applied a patch from Simon Williams to fix newgrp
  when run in a 'script' or 'screen' session.
a/sysvinit-2.84-i386-25.tgz:  In rc.S, don't try to run rc.modules unless
  /proc/modules exists (thanks to Gerardo Exequiel Pozzi).  Reboot without
  sulogin if fsck returns a code of 2 or 3 (thanks to Jaroslaw Swierczynski).  
  In rc.M, don't activate hotplug unless the kernel supports modules.
ap/vim-6.1-i386-7.tgz:  Updated vim patches through 6.1.385.
  If /usr/bin/vi doesn't already link to elvis, make a link to vim.
  (suggested by Lech Szychowski)
d/kernel-headers-2.4.20-i386-3.tgz:  Applied Andrew Morton's ext3 patches.
k/kernel-source-2.4.20-noarch-3.tgz:  Applied Andrew Morton's ext3 patches.
l/db3-3.3.11-i386-3.tgz:  Applied patch.3.3.11.1 to fix db185 problems.
t/tetex-2.0.2-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to tetex-2.0.2.
t/tetex-doc-2.0.2-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to docs from tetex-2.0.2.
xap/xchat-2.0.1-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to xchat-2.0.1.
  (suggested by guilherme and Yann Brillouet)
xap/xvim-6.1-i386-7.tgz:  Updated vim patches through 6.1.385.
  If /usr/bin/vi doesn't already link to elvis, make a link to vim.
  (suggested by Lech Szychowski)
+--------------------------+
Sat Mar  8 00:33:50 PST 2003
rootdisks/install.*, isolinux/initrd.img:  Don't offer to install a software
  series if it wasn't burned on the install CD.  
  Thanks to P. Pitts Dockman for the suggestion.
extra/sgml-tools-1.0.9/sgml-tools-1.0.9-i386-7.tgz:  Fixed ownerships on
  /usr/bin and gtkdoc tools.
extra/xlockmore-5.06/xlockmore-5.06-i386-1.tgz:  I've always enjoyed xlock, but
  IMHO it was time to move it out of the default install.
a/etc-5.0-noarch-10.tgz:  Don't set LC_ALL in /etc/profile.  Instead, add
  /etc/profile.d/ add lang.sh and lang.csh to set LANG.  Thanks to penguinista.
a/gpm-1.19.6-i386-5.tgz:  Autodetect USB mouse in setup.mouse.
a/hotplug-2002_08_26-noarch-3.tgz:  Mount usbfs, not usbdevfs.
a/lilo-22.5-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to lilo-22.5.
a/pkgtools-8.9.1-i386-3.tgz:  Don't set a (US) keyboard in the default
  XF86Config-vesa.  Also, a minor patch to xfree86setup to insure the freetype
  module is loaded.
a/sysvinit-2.84-i386-24.tgz:  Try to run fc-cache at boot.
d/distcc-1.2.3-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to distcc-1.2.3.
gnome/libbonoboui-2.2.0.1-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to libbonoboui-2.2.0.1.
n/iptables-1.2.7a-i386-2.tgz:  Recompiled to enable new 2.4.20 features.
n/pine-4.53-i386-3.tgz:  Added pinepgp-0.18.0.
n/netatalk-1.6.1-i386-2.tgz:  This was still missing --with-shadow.
  (Thanks again to Garrick Meeker)
n/samba-2.2.7a-i386-4.tgz:  Moved rc.samba into /etc/rc.d, and made it chmod 644
  so that after a full installation Samba will not attempt to start by default
  (without an installed smb.conf it won't start anyway).  To get it to start at
  boot, chmod 755 /etc/rc.d/rc.samba, and install a config file
  (/etc/samba/smb.conf).
n/tcpip-0.17-i386-16.tgz:  Detect more network cards in netconfig, and fix
  loopback setup (thanks to John Yost).
xap/gnuplot-3.7.3-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to gnuplot-3.7.3.
xap/xscreensaver-4.08-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to xscreensaver-4.08.
+--------------------------+
Thu Mar  6 20:40:09 PST 2003
n/netatalk-1.6.1-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to netatalk-1.6.1.  (suggested by
  Garrick Meeker, as it's needed to build against the new OpenSSL, and it
  fixes a problem with using MD5 passwords with netatalk).
tcl/tcl-8.4.2-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to tcl-8.4.2.
tcl/tk-8.4.2-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to tk-8.4.2.
xap/mozilla-1.2.1-i386-3.tgz:  Mozilla is no longer stuck on the Modern theme.
+--------------------------+
Thu Mar  6 00:02:35 PST 2003
a/gzip-1.3.3-i386-2.tgz:  Added missing docs.
a/pcmcia-cs-3.2.4-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to pcmcia-cs-3.2.4.  Fixed network
  script to find the dhcpcd pid file correctly (thanks to GertJan Spoelman
  David Nordenberg, and Harri Olin, who all reported this issue :-).
kde/kdebase-3.1-i386-3.tgz:  Rebuilt against openssl-0.9.7a.
n/apache-1.3.27-i386-2.tgz:  chmod 644 /etc/rc.d/rc.httpd, so that after a
  full installation Apache will NOT start at boot by default.  Upgrading to
  this package will also disable starting Apache at boot until you execute
  chmod 755 /etc/rc.d/rc.httpd.
n/proftpd-1.2.8-i386-2.tgz:  The install script now removes any existing
  files in /var/run/proftpd.  Otherwise, old files may prevent ProFTPD from
  starting up from inetd.  (reported by Luigi Genoni)
+--------------------------+
Wed Mar  5 01:28:34 PST 2003
Recompiled glibc using a patch by Lance Larsh (via Alessandro Suardi and
Luigi Genoni) to fix a problem in the dynamic loader that broke Oracle
(and some other binaries).  This same patch was included in glibc-2.3.2 by
Ulrich Drepper as noted here in the glibc ChangeLog:

        * sysdeps/mips/dl-machine.h (ELF_MACHINE_RUNTIME_TRAMPOLINE): Fix
        masking of version index.
        Patch by Lance Larsh <Lance.Larsh@oracle.com>.

I'm sure many of you were hoping to see an update to glibc-2.3.2 here, but I
don't see anything to be gained by switching to 2.3.2 at the last minute.  I've
been testing it here, and although the ctype patch applies cleanly the result
does not compile.  Without the patch, most existing static binaries will again
be broken under glibc-2.3.2 (this has been tested here with CompuPic).
IMHO, it's best to leave the glibc-2.3.2 issues for later.
extra/glibc-extra-packages/glibc-debug-2.3.1-i386-3.tgz:  Patched, recompiled.
extra/glibc-extra-packages/glibc-profile-2.3.1-i386-3.tgz:  Patched,

  Many thanks to William Hunt for the bug report and patch.  :-)
a/bin-8.5.0-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to file-3.41.  This fixes a buffer overflow

kde/kdelibs-3.1-i386-2.tgz:  Rebuilt against openssl-0.9.7a.  Luigi Genoni
  reported that this wasn't linking properly against the new OpenSSL libs, and
  this prompted me to rebuild many things that link with OpenSSL.  If anyone
  spots any more problems, please let me know.
l/fontconfig-1.0.1-i386-4.tgz:  Removed.  (fontconfig is part of XFree86 4.3.0)
l/pango-1.2.1-i386-2.tgz:  Rebuilt against freetype-2.1.1 from XFree86-4.3.0.
l/xft2-2.0.0-i386-2.tgz:  Removed.  (Xft2 is part of XFree86 4.3.0)
n/curl-7.10.3-i386-2.tgz:  Rebuilt against openssl-0.9.7a.

extra/gimp-1.3.12/gimp-1.3.12-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to gimp-1.3.12.
extra/iproute2-2.4.7-now-ss020116-try/iproute2-2.4.7_now_ss020116_try-i386-3.tgz:
  Patched to add HTB support.

extra/links-2.1pre7/links-2.1pre7-i386-1.tgz:  Added links-2.1pre7 with support
  for Javascript and graphical mode using SVGAlib or the framebuffer.
extra/parted-1.6.5/parted-1.6.5-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to parted-1.6.5.
pasture/libxml-1.8.17/libxml-1.8.17-i386-2.tgz:  Moved to pasture.
rootdisks/install.*, isolinux/initrd.img:  Updated raidtools, nl keymap.
a/cxxlibs-5.0.2-i386-1.tgz:  Updated to libstdc++.so.5.0.2.
a/elflibs-9.0.0-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to the latest versions, added CUPS and
  font handling libraries.
a/hotplug-2002_08_26-noarch-2.tgz:  Add support for bringing up network
  interfaces with /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1 (thanks to David Nordenberg), added
  video framebuffer modules to /etc/hotplug/blacklist.
a/kbd-1.08-i386-2.tgz:  Merged in fixes for the nl.map from Eric Hameleers.
a/openssl-solibs-0.9.7a-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to openssl-0.9.7a.
a/pciutils-2.1.11-i386-4.tgz:  Added libpci.a and headers.

a/shadow-4.0.3-i386-5.tgz:  Updated to adduser-1.05 (from Stuart Winter).
a/sysvinit-2.84-i386-23.tgz:  On shutdown, try to stop Apache and process
  accounting.  Also, kill dhcpcd before bringing down interfaces so that
  the DHCP leases are released.
a/tcsh-6.12.00-i386-2.tgz:  Stripped binary.
ap/espgs-7.05.6-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to espgs-7.05.6.
  This replaces the ghostscript package.
ap/hpijs-1.3.1-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to hpijs-1.3.1.
ap/raidtools-1.00.3-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to raidtools-1.00.3.
d/gcc-3.2.2-i386-2.tgz:  Updated openssl/bn.h and linux/zconf.h headers.  It
  looks like new compiler packages will become quite common, since header
  updates have to be synced into the gcc package (after a full compiler rebuild,
  of course).  If you upgrade libraries yourself, be aware that old headers in
  /usr/lib/gcc-lib/*/*/include/ may cause compiles to fail.  Presumably as the
  headers are updated to comply with standards it will become unneccessary to
  maintain modified copies, but for now it has to be done.
d/perl-5.8.0-i386-3.tgz:  Rebuilt against db3-3.3.11.
gnome/libmikmod-3.1.10-i386-2.tgz:  Fixed perms on /usr/lib/libmikmod.*

t/tetex-2.0.1-i386-2.tgz:  Rebuilt using --with-system-t1lib.
tcl/expect-5.38-i386-2.tgz:  Patched "weather" script to use wunderground.com.
xap/pan-0.13.4-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to pan-0.13.4.
xap/xmms-1.2.7-i386-6.tgz:  Dropped support for CDIndex since it requires the
  obsolete version of libxml.  Use the CDDB protocol instead.
xap/xpaint-2.6.9-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to xpaint-2.6.9.
y/bsd-games-2.13-i386-5.tgz:  Replaced a few missing games.
----------------------------
Sun Feb 23 17:52:26 PST 2003
rootdisks/install.*, isolinux/initrd.img:  USB keyboard support.
xap/pan-0.13.3-i386-1.tgz:  Switched to (stable) pan-0.13.3.

  Added an extra package of kernel modules for use with the xfs.i
  (SGI XFS filesystem patched) kernel.  It seems there are enough changes
  in the patch all over the kernel that modules compiled for a vanilla
  2.4.20 kernel will not load against a kernel patched with XFS.  
  Let's hope XFS makes it into the main kernel soon...  I'd hate to have
  to haul this package around forever.  ;-)

d/gcc-3.2.1-i386-3.tgz:  Removed old curses.h header from
  /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-slackware-linux/3.2.1/include/ (this was
  missed last time).
n/php-4.3.0-i386-2.tgz:  Moved mysql.so module into
  /usr/lib/php/extensions.
  Edited php.ini examples to add extension_dir=/usr/lib/php/extensions/
  and extension=mysql.so.
  Fixed chmod 666 files under /usr/lib/php/.
  Changed ./configure option from --mysql=shared to --mysql=shared,/dir
  which fixes the module (thanks Jimmy Zhou).

XFree86 has been updated to version 4.2.1.1 from CVS, which merges in
the previous security patches as well as some important bug fixes (such
as a crash upon leaving DRM that I've been trying to figure out ever
since 4.2.1 came out).
Oh, and happy new year!  :-)

a/bzip2-1.0.2-i386-4.tgz:  Recompiled.
ap/rpm-4.0.2-i386-4.tgz:  Recompiled, then swapped in the /bin/rpm from
  rpm-4.0.2-i386-2, which was the last version that didn't produce RPMs
  containing random MD5 errors.  It seems like something about either the
  new glibc or gcc is causing problems with the static rpm binary, and tests
  on newer versions seem to have even more bugs (4.1, for instance, doesn't
  want to build RPMs at all -- it leaves nothing in /usr/src/rpm/RPMS, but
  also gives no indication of failure).  Anyway, we'll go with this for now.
  The broken rpm-4.1 source and build scripts are in source/ap/rpm/4.1.
  If anyone has a real handle on why a vanilla build of 4.1 can't build
  SRPMS, I'm accepting hints.  :-)
kde/koffice-1.2.1-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to koffice-1.2.1.
  (this package will work with KDE-3.0.5 or newer)
kdei/koffice-i18n-*.tgz:  Upgraded to koffice-1.2.1.
  (kde-i18n-ca is producing an empty package -- looking into that)
l/zlib-1.1.4-i386-3.tgz:  Recompiled.
An update on http://slackware.com:
As many of you have noticed, the slackware.com website is not online.  
We offer our apologies, but we've been the target of DoS attacks for a few
days.  We're investigating the problem, but can't give an estimate of when
the site will return.  If anyone has any additional information that might
be helpful to us in tracking down the source of these attacks, please email
us at security@slackware.com.  Thanks for your patience.

a/e2fsprogs-1.32-i386-2.tgz:  Fixed minor install-info bug in install script,
  thanks to LukenShiro.
l/libxml2-2.4.25-i386-2.tgz:  Reverted to version 2.4.25, as this is the last
  version that works correctly with kdoctools.  Newer versions hang calling
  xmllint.
l/libxslt-1.0.23-i386-2.tgz:  Recompiled against libxml2-2.4.25.

  This replaces the mailx package.  (Suggested by Frdric L. W. Meunier)
----------------------------
Thu Nov 28 16:39:25 PST 2002
a/bin-8.3.0-i386-4.tgz:  Merged in a patch for rpm2targz from David Cantrell to
  put the contents of SRPMS into an appropriately named subdirectory.  I've
  modified this to use "file" to detect SRPMS (which works fine on Slackware).
  If you need a more portable approach, David's C program "getrpmtype" is
  included in source/a/bin, and should compile on most systems.  rpm2targz will
  use this utility if it's found in the $PATH.  Thanks David!  :-)
  Upgraded to which-2.14.

n/pine-4.50-i386-2.tgz:  Patched pine to actually look for the pine.conf,
  pine.conf.fixed, and pine.info files in /etc, not /etc/pine (where the
  original patch mistakenly had it looking).  Thanks to Stuart Winter for
  spotting this bug.

  (suggested by Stepan Roh)
n/samba-2.2.7-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to samba-2.2.7.  Some details (based on
  the WHATSNEW.txt file included in samba-2.2.7):
    This fixes a security hole discovered in versions 2.2.2 through 2.2.6 of
    Samba that could potentially allow an attacker to gain root access
    on the target machine.  The word "potentially" is used because there
    is no known exploit of this bug, and the Samba Team has not been able to
    craft one ourselves. However, the seriousness of the problem warrants
    this immediate 2.2.7 release.  There was a bug in the length checking for
    encrypted password change requests from clients. A client could potentially
    send an encrypted password, which, when decrypted with the old hashed
    password could be used as a buffer overrun attack on the stack of smbd. The
    attack would have to be crafted such that converting a DOS codepage string
    to little endian UCS2 unicode would translate into an executable block of
    code.  Thanks to Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org> and Eloy Paris
    <peloy@debian.org> for bringing this vulnerability to our notice.
  (* Security fix *)
  An unrelated change to the Slackware package is the addition of libsmbclient.
  This was suggested by Marcelo Anton, and should be a big help for smb://
  browsing with KDE (once kdebase is recompiled :-).
----------------------------
Tue Nov 19 16:09:38 PST 2002

  A note about nss_db:  it doesn't build anymore with gcc-3.2.
  I've placed the work-in-progress source and build script for it in
  source/l/nss_db/, if anyone wants to help get it working.  If you do,
  please let me know.

a/glibc-solibs-2.3.1-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to glibc-2.3.1.

l/db2-2.4.14-i386-1.tgz:  Added db-2.4.14 (Berkeley DB version 2).
l/db3-3.1.17-i386-1.tgz:  Added db-3.1.17 (Berkeley DB version 3).  I plan to
  look into upgrading this, but newer versions of db3 aren't compatible so it
  will take some recompiling elsewhere.
l/glibc-2.3.1-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to glibc-2.3.1.
l/glibc-i18n-2.3.1-noarch-1.tgz:  Upgraded to glibc-2.3.1.

extra/espgs-7.05.5/espgs-7.05.5-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to espgs-7.05.5.
  ESPGS is an advanced version of ghostscript designed to work with CUPS
  and the gimp-print library.
extra/glibc-extra-packages/glibc-debug-2.3.1-i386-1.tgz:  Added static and
  shared debuggable versions of the GNU C libraries (glibc-2.3.1).
extra/glibc-extra-packages/glibc-profile-2.3.1-i386-1.tgz:  Added versions of
  the GNU C libraries (glibc-2.3.1) for profiling binaries with gprof.
----------------------------
Mon Sep 30 23:33:26 PDT 2002
a/procps-2.0.9-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to procps-2.0.9.
gnome/galeon-1.2.6-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to galeon-1.2.6.
  (This package requires Mozilla 1.1)
n/dhcpcd-1.3.22pl3-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to dhcpcd-1.3.22pl3.
  From the dhcpcd ChangeLog:
    Simon Kelley <simon@thekelleys.org.uk> pointed out at security bug in dhcpcd
    related to *.info file. A malicios administrator of untrusted DHCP server
    may execute any command with root privileges on DHCP client machine by
    sending the command enclosed in shell metacharacters in one of DHCP server
    provided options. Fixed by enclosing all strings in *.info file into single
    quotes and replacing any single quotes found in DHCP option strings
    with space. - S.V.
  (* Security fix *)
n/lftp-2.6.2-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to lftp-2.6.2.

Sun Sep 29 12:38:04 PDT 2002
d/automake-1.7-noarch-2.tgz:  Fixed aclocal and automake symlinks.
----------------------------
Sat Sep 28 22:52:54 PDT 2002
rootdisks/install.1, install.2, isolinux/initrd.img:  Fixed installing
  via serial console (see updated FAQ Q34 for instructions).
  Thanks to Karl Magnus Kolst for the bug report.
a/cxxlibs-5.0.0-i386-2.tgz:  Replaced libstdc++.so.5.0.0 with the new
  version from gcc-g++-3.2-i386-2.tgz.  (compiled using
  --enable-__cxa_atexit)
d/autoconf-2.54-noarch-1.tgz:  Upgraded to autoconf-2.54.
d/automake-1.7-noarch-1.tgz:  Upgraded to automake-1.7.
----------------------------
Mon Sep 23 00:13:22 PDT 2002
a/bash-2.05b-i386-2.tgz:  Applied latest bash patches from ftp.gnu.org.
  This prevents bash from crashing on certain keypresses when TERM=xterm.
a/bin-8.3.0-i386-3.tgz:  Have rpm2tgz use rpm2cpio if it's there.  This
  is more reliable than the old approach of calculating the offset of
  the cpio archive and trying to extract it with dd.  If rpm2cpio is not
  installed then we fall back to the old method.
a/etc-5.0-noarch-8.tgz:  In /etc/nsswitch.conf, don't try to use dns to
  look up networks.
a/lilo-22.3.3-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to lilo-22.3.3.
  Changed liloconfig to use timeout instead of delay, and fixed the text
  formatting in several partition displays.
d/gcc-3.2-i386-2.tgz:  Recompiled with the following ./configure changes:
    --enable-threads=posix --enable-__cxa_atexit --disable-checking
  Previously we used --enable-threads.  I think [=posix] is the default
  on Linux, but it's probably best to make it an explicit option.
  --enable-__cxa_atexit was added when Mark Post reported that it's
  needed for correct C++ standards compliance (thanks, Mark!).
  --disable-checking seems to be in common use everywhere else.  
  The rumor is that using this will speed up the compiler.
d/gcc-g++-3.2-i386-2.tgz:  Recompiled.
d/gcc-g77-3.2-i386-2.tgz:  Recompiled.
d/gcc-gnat-3.2-i386-2.tgz:  Recompiled.
d/gcc-java-3.2-i386-2.tgz:  Recompiled.
d/gcc-objc-3.2-i386-2.tgz:  Recompiled.
kde/kdebase-3.0.3-i386-2.tgz:  Do not try to embed audio apps in Konqueror
  by default, as this is causes Konqueror to crash.  They work fine from
  Konqueror in standalone mode, so this has been made the new default.
  If anyone knows what's actually causing this, drop me an email.
n/yptools-2.7-i386-3.tgz:  Upgraded to ypserv-2.5.
----------------------------
Mon Sep 16 19:03:11 PDT 2002
a/kernel-modules-2.4.19-i386-3.tgz:  Rerun depmod -a.
a/lilo-22.2-i386-6.tgz:  In liloconfig, properly sort DOS partitions.
  This also ensures that we try to boot the proper DOS/Windows partition
  when installing lilo in "simple" mode.
kde/kdelibs-3.0.3a-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to kdelibs-3.0.3a.
kde/koffice-1.2-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to koffice-1.2.
kdei/koffice-i18n-*:  Upgraded to koffice-1.2.
x/xfree86-4.2.1-i386-2.tgz:  Recompiled with 4.2.1-mit-shm-security.patch,
  This is an update to 4.2.1 that fixes the shm vulnerability for the
  case where the server is running from xdm.  Also fixed a problem with
  freetype2 where there were two versions of the shared library on the
  system.
  (* Security fix *)
x/xfree86-devel-4.2.1-i386-2.tgz:  Recompiled with
  4.2.1-mit-shm-security.patch.
  (* Security fix *)
rootdisks/install.1, install.2:  Fixed the rootdisk loading problem.
  Split the installer into two parts so that we can use compression on the
  rootdisks again.  As a result, only 2 rootdisks are needed instead of 5.
  I'm pretty sure now that Slackware 8.1 is going to be remembered as the
  release with all the rootdisks. ;-)
----------------------------
Thu Sep  5 15:48:39 PDT 2002
a/kernel-modules-2.4.19-i386-2.tgz:  Upgraded to XFree86 4.2.1 DRI modules.
a/util-linux-2.11u-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to util-linux-2.11u.
ap/groff-1.17.2-i386-3.tgz:  Added zsoelim -> soelim symlink.
  groff-1.18 was tried, but this version adds ANSI color support and makes
  color support the default (which breaks everything I tried).
  Maybe we'll see saner defaults in 1.18.1...
d/automake-1.6.3-noarch-1.tgz:  Upgraded to automake-1.6.3.
xap/xmms-1.2.7-i386-3.tgz:  Recompiled against libogg-1.0.
  XFree86 update (* Security fix *) -- see RELNOTES in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/doc:

a/pciutils-2.1.10-i386-3.tgz:  Patched a memory handling error in pcimodules
   that caused it to hang on systems that use libsafe.
   Thanks to Dennis Bijwaard for the bug report.
----------------------------
Fri Aug 30 14:19:08 PDT 2002
We're happy to announce the initial Slackware-9.0-beta based on gcc-3.2. :-)
Please test it and report any bugs that you find.
a/aaa_base-8.9.9-i386-1.tgz:  Edited /etc/slackware-version.
a/bash-2.05b-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to bash-2.05b.
a/bzip2-1.0.2-i386-2.tgz:  Added bzcat symlink, and bzdiff, bzgrep, and
  bzmore scripts and manpages.
a/cpio-2.5-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to cpio-2.5.
a/gawk-3.1.1-i386-2.tgz:  Moved (g)awk from /usr/bin to /bin.  I don't
  like to do this, but it's becoming fairly common to see awk used in
  startup scripts.  For example, the hotplug support will require awk.
a/hotplug-2002_08_26-noarch-1.tgz:  Added hotplug-2002_08_26.  These are
  scripts to automatically initialize PCI, Cardbus, and USB devices when
  they are plugged into the system or at boot time.  Cardbus modules are
  now loaded by hotplug rather than pcmcia-cs.
a/pciutils-2.1.10-i386-2.tgz:  Added pcimodules (needed by hotplug).
a/pcmcia-cs-3.2.1-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to pcmcia-cs-3.2.1.
a/sysvinit-2.84-i386-20.tgz:  Edited /etc/rc.d/rc.M to start rc.hotplug.

t/tetex-doc-20020825-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to teTeX-beta-20020825.
xap/imagemagick-5.4.8_2-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to ImageMagick-5.4.8-2.
xap/mozilla-1.0-i386-2.tgz:  Recompiled with gcc-3.2/libstdc++.so.5.
  Note that various Netscape plugins such as Java and flash will need to be
  recompiled using gcc-3.2 before they will work with a gcc-3.2 compiled
  Mozilla, galeon, Konqueror, or other browser.  The plugins will continue
  to work in Netscape, so if you must have working plugins you'll need to
  use that (at least for now).
xap/netscape-7.0-i686-1.tgz:  Upgraded to Netscape 7.0.
----------------------------
Fri Aug 23 21:22:03 PDT 2002

----------------------------
Tue Jul 30 19:45:52 PDT 2002
patches/packages/apache-1.3.26-i386-2.tgz:  Upgraded the included libmm
  to version 1.2.1.  Versions of libmm earlier than 1.2.0 contain a tmp file
  vulnerability which may allow the local Apache user to gain privileges via
  temporary files or symlinks.  For details, see:
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-0658
  This was also recompiled using EAPI patch from mod_ssl-2.8.10_1.3.26.
  (* Security fix *)
patches/packages/glibc-2.2.5-i386-3.tgz:  Patched to fix a buffer overflow
  in glibc's DNS resolver functions that look up network addresses.
  Another workaround for this problem is to edit /etc/nsswtich.conf changing:
    networks:       files dns
  to:
    networks:       files
  (* Security fix *)
patches/packages/glibc-solibs-2.2.5-i386-3.tgz:  Patched to fix a buffer
  overflow in glibc's DNS resolver functions that look up network addresses.
  (* Security fix *)
patches/packages/mod_ssl-2.8.10_1.3.26-i386-1.tgz:  This update fixes an
  off-by-one error in earlier versions of mod_ssl that may allow local users to
  execute code as the Apache user.  For more information, see:
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-0653
  (* Security fix *)
patches/packages/openssh-3.4p1-i386-2.tgz:  Recompiled against openssl-0.9.6e.
  This update also contains a fix to the installation script to ensure that the
  sshd privsep user is correctly created.
patches/packages/openssl-0.9.6e-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to openssl-0.9.6e, which
  fixes 4 potentially remotely exploitable bugs.  For details, see:
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-0659
  (* Security fix *)
patches/packages/openssl-solibs-0.9.6e-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to openssl-0.9.6e,
  which fixes 4 potentially remotely exploitable bugs.  For details, see:

  (* Security fix *)
patches/packages/php-4.2.2-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to php-4.2.2.  Earlier versions
  of PHP 4.2.x contain a security vulnerability, which although not currently
  considered exploitable on the x86 architecture is probably still a good to
  patch.  For details, see:  http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2002-21.html
  (* Security fix *)
----------------------------
Wed Jun 26 12:03:06 PDT 2002
patches/packages/openssh-3.4p1-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to openssh-3.4p1.
  This version enables privilege separation by default.  The README.privsep file
  says this about it:

     Privilege separation, or privsep, is method in OpenSSH by which operations
     that require root privilege are performed by a separate privileged monitor
     process.  Its purpose is to prevent privilege escalation by containing
     corruption to an unprivileged process.  More information is available at:
       http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/provos/ssh/privsep.html

  Note that ISS has released an advisory on OpenSSH (OpenSSH Remote Challenge
  Vulnerability).  Slackware is not affected by this issue, as we have never
  included AUTH_BSD, S/KEY, or PAM.  Unless at least one of these options is
  compiled into sshd, it is not vulnerable.  Further note that none of these
  options are turned on in a default build from source code, so if you have
  built sshd yourself you should not be vulnerable unless you've enabled one
  of these options.

  Regardless, the security provided by privsep is unquestionably better.
  This time we (Slackware) were lucky, but next time we might not be.
  Therefore we recommend that all sites running the OpenSSH daemon (sshd,
  enabled by default in Slackware 8.1) upgrade to this new openssh package.
  After upgrading the package, restart the daemon like this:

  /etc/rc.d/rc.sshd restart

  We would like to thank Theo and the rest of the OpenSSH team for
  their quick handling of this issue, Niels Provos and Markus Friedl for
  implementing privsep, and Solar Designer for working out issues with
  privsep on 2.2 Linux kernels.

Slackware 8.1.01-stable is released.
a/sysvinit-2.84-i386-19.tgz:  Added -M to fix quotacheck for reiserfs.
d/cvs-1.11.2-i386-2.tgz:  Added docs in text format.
n/apache-1.3.26-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to apache-1.3.26.
  This fixes the issue described in:
  "CERT Advisory CA-2002-17 Apache Web Server Chunk Handling Vulnerability"
  While the impact of this issue is minimal on 32 bit Linux systems, we felt it
  was important enough to stop the presses and get these fixes in before sending
  the Slackware 8.1 discs in for replication.
  (* Security fix *)
n/mod_ssl-2.8.9_1.3.26-i386-1.tgz:  Upgraded to mod_ssl-2.8.9_1.3.26.
rootdisks/rescue.dsk:  Added network/pcmcia scripts.
