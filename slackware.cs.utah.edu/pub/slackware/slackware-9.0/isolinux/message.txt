Welcome to 09Slackware07 version 9.0.0 (Linux kernel 2.4.20)!

If you need to pass extra parameters to the kernel, enter them at the prompt
below after the name of the kernel to boot (scsi.s etc).  NOTE: In most cases 
the kernel will detect your hardware, and parameters are not needed.

Here are some examples (and more can be found in the BOOTING file):
    hdx=cyls,heads,sects,wpcom,irq  (needed in rare cases where probing fails)
or hdx=cdrom (force detection of an IDE/ATAPI CD-ROM drive) where hdx can be
any of hda through hdh.

In a pinch, you can boot your system from here with a command like:

For example, if the Linux system were on /dev/hda1.

boot: bare.i root=/dev/hda1 noinitrd ro 

This prompt is just for entering extra parameters.  If you don't need to enter
any parameters, hit ENTER to boot the default kernel "bare.i" or press [F2] 
for a listing of more kernel choices.
