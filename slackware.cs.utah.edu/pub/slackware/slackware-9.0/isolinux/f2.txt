You'll need one kernel to get Linux started on your system so that you can 
install it.  Because of the possibility of collisions between the various 
Linux drivers, several kernels have been provided.  You should use the one 
with the least drivers possible to maximize your chances of success.  

***************************************************************************
* Tip:  If you have no idea which kernel to use, Try one of these.        *
*       If you have a IDE system choose "bare.i".                         *
*       If you have a SCSI system choose "scsi.s" or "scsi2.s".           *
***************************************************************************

To boot the chosen kernel put the name of the kernel and press enter.

boot: bare.i   "For example, boot the 'bare.i' kernel!"

Press the [F3] key for a complete list of kernel choices (including patched
