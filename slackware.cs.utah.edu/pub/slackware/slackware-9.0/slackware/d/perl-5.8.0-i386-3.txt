perl:
perl: Larry Wall's "Practical Extraction and Report Language".  Perl is a
perl: language optimized for scanning arbitrary text files, extracting
perl: information from those text files, and printing reports based on that
perl: information.  It's also a good language for many system management
perl: tasks.  The language is intended to be practical (easy to use,
perl: efficient, complete) rather than beautiful (tiny, elegant, minimal).
