lesstif: lesstif (a free replacement for OSF/Motif(R))
lesstif:
lesstif: LessTif is the Hungry Programmers' (www.hungry.com) free clone of
lesstif: Motif(R). It aims to be source compatible with OSF/Motif(R) meaning
lesstif: that the same source code should compile with both and work exactly
lesstif: the same.  This package contains the libraries and header files to
lesstif: be able to run and compile Motif applications, along with the lesstif
lesstif: version of mwm, the Motif window manager.
