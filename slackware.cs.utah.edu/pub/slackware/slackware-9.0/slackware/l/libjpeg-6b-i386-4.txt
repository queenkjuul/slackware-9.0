libjpeg:
libjpeg: Software to implement JPEG image compression and decompression.  JPEG
libjpeg: (pronounced 'jay-peg') is a standardized compression method for
libjpeg: full-color and gray-scale images.  JPEG is intended for compressing
libjpeg: 'real-world' scenes; cartoons and other non-realistic images are not
libjpeg: its strong suit.  JPEG is lossy, however, on typical images of
libjpeg: real-world scenes, very good compression levels can be obtained with
libjpeg: no visible change, and amazingly high compression levels are possible
libjpeg: if you can tolerate a low-quality image.
