slocate: slocate (Secure Locate)
slocate:
slocate: Slocate is an enhanced version of locate, a command to help you locate
slocate: files on the system.  Like the original version of locate, Slocate
slocate: maintains a database of files on the system, updating it nightly.
slocate: Unlike the original, Slocate indexes every file on the machine rather
slocate: than only the ones that can be seen by everyone.  The "secure" part of
slocate: slocate is that it will only return matches if the user is allowed to
slocate: see the files.
