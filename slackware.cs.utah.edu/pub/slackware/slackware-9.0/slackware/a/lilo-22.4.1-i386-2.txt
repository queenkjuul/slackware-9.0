lilo: lilo (Linux Loader)
lilo:
lilo: Generic Boot Loader for Linux ('LInux LOader') by Werner Almesberger.
lilo: LILO boots Linux from your hard drive. It can also boot other
lilo: operating systems such as MS-DOS and OS/2, and can even boot DOS from
lilo: the second hard drive. LILO comes with utilities and documentation
lilo: that make it easier to install, such as 'liloconfig' and 'QuickStart'.
lilo: NOTE: Installing boot loaders is inherently dangerous. Be sure to have
lilo: some means to boot your system from a different media if you install
lilo: LILO on your hard disk.
