elflibs:
elflibs: This is a collection of shared libraries needed to run Linux programs.
elflibs: ELF (Executable and Linking Format) is the standard Linux binary 
elflibs: format.  These libraries are gathered from other Slackware packages
elflibs: and are intended to give a fairly complete set of runtime ELF
elflibs: libraries without having to install every package these libraries come
elflibs: from.  If you're doing a full installation, these libraries are
elflibs: redundant, but installing them doesn't hurt.
