lvm: lvm (Logical Volume Manager)
lvm:
lvm: Heinz Mauelshagen's LVM (Logical Volume Manager) for Linux.
lvm: LVM adds an additional layer between the physical peripherals and the
lvm: I/O interface in the 2.4.x kernel to get a logical view of disks.  
lvm: This allows the concatenation of several disks (so-called physical
lvm: volumes or PVs) to form a storage pool (so-called Volume Group or VG)
lvm: with allocation units called physical extents (called PE).  With LVM,
lvm: you can actually extend, resize, or relocate storage dynamically.
