espgs: ESP Ghostscript is a customized version of GNU Ghostscript, an
espgs: interpreter of Adobe Systems' PostScript(tm) and Portable Document

espgs: converting it into an appropriate printer or display format.
espgs: Ghostscript supports many printers directly, and more are supported
espgs: through gimp-print and HPIJS, which are add-on packages that work
espgs: with Ghostscript's IJS driver.
