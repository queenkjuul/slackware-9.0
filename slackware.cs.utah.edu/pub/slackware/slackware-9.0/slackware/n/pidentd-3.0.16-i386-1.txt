pidentd: pidentd (TCP/IP IDENT protocol server)
pidentd:
pidentd: The identd daemon implements the IDENT protocol as specified in
pidentd: RFC1413.  When your machine connects to a remote system, the remote
pidentd: machine may connect to your identd daemon to find out either the
pidentd: user name or other information about the process that initiated
pidentd: the connection.  Some remote machines may choose not to allow your
pidentd: connections if you do not provide access to an identd daemon.
