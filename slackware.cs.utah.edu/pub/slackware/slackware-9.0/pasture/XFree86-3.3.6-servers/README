These are the X server packages from XFree86 3.3.6.  If you have a video card
that is not working under XFree86-4.x, you can try installing the appropriate
3.3.6 server on top of your XFree86-4 installation to see if that gets it
working.  All of these servers will work fine with the newer libraries that are
installed with XFree86-4.x.

IMPORTANT!  Unless you either make the servers setuid root (not recommended),
or install the xwrapper package, X will only be usable by root.  You can pick
up a copy of the xwrapper package here in this directory.  It contains Xwrapper
(a setuid root wrapper program for the X binary), and a version of xinit that
knows to use Xwrapper to start the server.

Also included in this directory is xset.tgz, the XF86Setup tool.  This might
come in handy for producing your XF86Config file.  To use it, you'll need to
install both the server for your video card and xvg16.tgz (16 color VGA server).

Have fun!
