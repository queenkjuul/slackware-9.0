xw32: A server for chipsets in the ET4000/W32 series.
xw32:
xw32: This server currently supports the w32, w32i, w32p and et6000 chips.
xw32: XF86_W32 gets phased out, now that the SVGA server with XAA 
xw32: acceleration is at least as fast as the W32 server but supports more
xw32: cards and higher color depths.  Use this server if the SVGA server
xw32: fails to work/accelerate for you.
xw32:
xw32: Installing this package will create a link in /usr/X11R6/bin from
xw32: XF86_W32 to X, setting this server as the default.
