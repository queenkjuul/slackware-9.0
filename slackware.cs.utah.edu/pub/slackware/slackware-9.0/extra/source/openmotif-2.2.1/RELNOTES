This document provides Release notes for Open Motif 2.2.1.
This contains information on what is new in Open Motif 2.2.1
Please see the COPYRIGHT.MOTIF file included with this release.


Introduction

This document and accompanying text files contain important
information. Please read them carefully before starting the build and
installation procedures.

There are two ways to build OpenMotif: (Imake and AutoTools)

IF you are using Imake please read INSTALL.imake for notes on how
to build and install this product using Imake.

Please see the file INSTALL.configure on how to build and install
this product using the autoconf tools. This method is not yet supported
and doesn't always work. The recommended build method is still using
Imake.



1 What is Open Motif 2.2

Open Motif is the freely available source code distribution for a
user interface component toolkit.  Open Motif is built on top
of the standard X Toolkit(Xt) and X11 libraries.

1.1 Overview of Open Motif

Open Motif 2.2 is an updated version of 2.1.  Any applications
built against a previous 2.X release of Open Motif will be
compatible with this release.  This is a source code release.
After downloading the distribution, it will need to be unpacked
and compiled.  The distribution contains the following items:

     libXm source code and include files
     Open Motif reference documentation (man pages)
     Utility libraries
     Demo programs


2 What is unchanged in Open Motif 2.2

This is an update release, with alls of the existing functional-
ity (widgets, convenience functions, resources, etc) unchanged.
There have been no widgets removed from the set, and several have
been added.

3 What is new in Open Motif 2.2

The major new functionality in 2.2 is the addition of ten new widgets to the
existing toolkit.  These widgets expand Motif's capabilities in several
areas, including geometry management, resource specification, and user
interaction.

Open Motif 2.2 also adds in user-defined "ToolTips" to all widgets that are a
subclass of XmPrimitive.  Any widget that is a child of a VendorShell gains
this functionality.

All libraries used in this release are compatible with previous
Motif 2.X releases. However, applications or widgets that access internal
Motif structures may require a recompile. See Section 7 for details.  


3.1 ToolTips

All widgets in Open Motif that are subclassed from XmPrimitive or XmGadget
support the ability to display user-defined "ToolTips", small labels that
appear in their own shell over the designated widget.  By setting the
XmtoolTipEnable resource on the main application shell (or any subclass of
VendorShell), each child widget gains the ability to show a ToolTip.  The
text for each widget's tooltip is contained in the XmtoolTipString resource
for that widget.

3.2 New Widgets

Open Motif 2.2 adds ten new widgets to the toolkit. 

3.2.1 XmButtonBox

The XmRowColumn widget is often used as a general layout manager, when in
actuality it was designed for menu support.  As a result, application
programmers often end up fighting with the widget to make it behave as they
want.  To rectify this, the XmButtonBox was created to manage children
(usually buttons) specifically in a single row or column layout.

3.2.2 XmColorSelector

This widget lets an end user choose a color using RGB sliders or by
specifying a color name taken from the RBG database.  The selected color is
displayed dynamically.

3.2.3 XmColumn

The XmColumn widget displays its children stacked in a column, each with an
optional associated label.  The labels appear in one column and the children
in another.  This greatly simplifies the creation of entry forms.

3.2.4 XmDataField

A subclass of XmTextField, the XmDataField widget handles display and entry
of data as text.  In addition to the normal functionality of XmTextField, it
adds regular expression parsing and input validity checking.

3.2.5 XmExt18List

The Extended Internationalized (I18N) List widget supports multiple columns,
colored text, internationalized string, and pixmap display.  The list can be
scrolled horizontally or vertically.  Additionally, it provides hooks for
adding user-defined searching and sorting functionality.

3.2.6 XmFontSelector

The XmFontSelector widget introduces a widget-based method for end users to
dynamically specify an X Logical Font Description (XLFD) interactively.  Font
family, size, scaling, and encoding are all selectable, and the resulting
font set is displayed.  Non-XLFD fonts are also displayable through this
widget.  Wildcarding is also supported.

3.2.7 XmIconBox

This widget lays out its children on a grid, forcing each child to be the
same size.  New cells are automatically added when it is resized.  The
location of each child widget is specified as an X and Y location on the
grid.

3.2.8 XmIconButton

Similar to the existing XmPushButton, the XmIconButton provides a selectable
object that can simultaneously display both a label and a pixmap.  It
supports the same set of callbacks as PushButton does.

3.2.9 XmTabStack

Designed to be a light-weight solution, the XmTabStack manages a group of
widgets but only allows one child to be visible at a time.  Children are
selected by selected the associated tab field.  Tabs can be configured to
display on any side of the TabStack.

3.2.10 XmTree

The XmTree widget, another new container, displays its children in a
tree-like format, showing a virtual parent-child relationship.  Portions of
this hierarchy can be opened and closed dynamically by the user.

3.3 Autotool Build Process
It is now possible to build Open Motif using the Autotools. Please see 
the file INSTALL.configure on how to build and install this product using
the autoconf tools. 

The Autotools are distributed under the GPL (see http://www.gnu.org). In 
providing this alternative build process, several configurations files were
pre-generated that are covered by the GPL. In addition, during the build
process itself, several files may be generated that are also covered by the
GPL. None of these files are linked into Open Motif itself. They are
exclusively used in controlling the building of Open Motif. Consequently,
their inclusion with this distribution does not effect the license under
which Open Motif is distributed. The GPL Licensing FAQ:
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html provides more details on this type
of use.

6. Documentation

and reference manuals), see URL

7. User Widget Compatibility Note

Some structures in existing widgets have been changed in 
OpenMotif 2.2. This can cause compatibility problems that require
a recompile if your application accesses any of the internal data
structures of Motif Widgets and does not use the correct XmField 
Macros. The most common situation for this problem is when your
application uses internally developed widgets or widgets acquired
from a third party. In this situation, please confirm that the 
widgets use the XmField widgets. See the Motif 2.1 Widget Writer's 
Guide (Section 14.2) for details.


8. Change Log

2.2.1 January 29, 2002

a. The Test directory that contained the automated tests was 
mentioned in the Release Notes but absent from source distribution. 
The reference in the Release Notes was removed. The Tests are still
available from the CVS tree.

b. Due to an oversight, imake support was not included in 
distribution. It was added back in this update.

c. If an older version of Open Motif was installed, the Autoconf
build would pick up the older #include files and fail. The
Autoconf configuration files were updated to use the proper
#include files.

d. Formating errors in doc/man/man3/Makefile.am were corrected.

e. The directory demos/unsupported/motifshell contained no source 
code but was mentioned in configure.in. The proper source code was
placed in this directory.

f. ToolTip.c and SlideC.c were included in config.h twice. The
extra reference was removed.

g. The demos for the new widgets were originally placed in the
directory demos/programs/newwidgets. To maintain consistency,
they were moved to demos/programs.

h. The Releases Notes specified the incorrect resource names for
enabling tooltips and specifying the string. These typos were
corrected. 

i. Compatibility note for user developed widgets was added to
Release Notes.
