Title:		xlockmore
Version:	5.03
Entered-date:	25Jan02
Description:	Patrick Naughton's xlock & 100+ more modes.
		New options -inwindow, -inroot, -geometry, -icongeometry,
		-install, -lockdelay; which allows you to run it in a window,
		in the root window, in a different size/location, change the
		size of the iconified window, to install a new colormap, and
		delay locking for use with xautolock.  Options can now be
		passed to modes.  Also improvements in portability.  It also
		has compile time switches for use in a public lab and personal
		use.  Supports Mesa/OpenGL and XPM modes, (highly desirable)
		but not required.
Keywords:	xlock, screen saver, screen lock
