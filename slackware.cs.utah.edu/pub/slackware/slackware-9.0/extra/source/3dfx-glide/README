Slackware 3Dfx Sources
======================

This is the Slackware Linux 3Dfx package source directory.  Each subdirectory
represents a Slackware package.  Each package is built with the protopkg
tool that can be found on ftp.slackware.com in
/pub/slackware/unsupported/protopkg.

The get-3dfx-cvs.sh script will fetch a current copy of the 3Dfx sources and
place them in the appropriate locations within this source tree.
