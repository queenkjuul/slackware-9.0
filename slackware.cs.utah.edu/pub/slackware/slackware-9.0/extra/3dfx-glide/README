Slackware Linux 3Dfx Support Packages
-------------------------------------

This directory contains packages for adding 3Dfx support to Slackware.  All
of the packages in this directory can be installed using the "installpkg"
command.  Refer to the man page for installpkg for more information.

1.  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

       The packages in this directory are generic 3Dfx support packages and
       can be installed on all systems with a 3Dfx graphics card.  The
       various subdirectories contain the specific support packages for each
       card.  Here's an overview of the installation process:

       a.  Determine your 3Dfx card.  For example, if you have a Voodoo 2
           card, you will want to use the packages from the "voodoo2"
           subdirectory.

       b.  Install the packages from your card's subdirectory.  You may
           install only the versions of Glide you want, but installing them
           all does not hurt anything.  Use the installpkg(8) command to 
           install them on your system.


2.  COMMON PACKAGE DESCRIPTIONS

       These packages work with all 3Dfx cards and are to be used in
       conjunction with the appropriate Glide package(s) for your 3Dfx card.
