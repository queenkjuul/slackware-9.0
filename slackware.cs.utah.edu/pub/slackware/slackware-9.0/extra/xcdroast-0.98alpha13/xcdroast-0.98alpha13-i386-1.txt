xcdroast: xcdroast (Graphical frontend for cdrtools)
xcdroast:
xcdroast: X-CD-Roast is a graphical frontend for the command line cdrtools.
xcdroast: You can do anything X-CD-Roast does yourself using the command line
xcdroast: tools - but it's nicer and easier with the frontend.  The cdrtools
xcdroast: contain "cdrecord" (which does the actual writing of CDs), "readcd"
xcdroast: (reads data tracks of CDs"), "mkisofs" (masters CD images), and
xcdroast: "cdda2wav" (reads audio tracks).  Cdrecord, readcd and mkisofs are
xcdroast: maintained by Joerg Schilling, cdda2wav by Heiko Eissfeldt, and
xcdroast: X-CD-Roast by Thomas Niederreiter.
