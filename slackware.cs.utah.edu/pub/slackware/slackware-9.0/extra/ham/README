Packaging for Slackware by Arno Verhoeven <pe1icq@amsat.org>
These packages are made for use with a glibc2 based Slackware Linux 
distribution. They should not be used with Slackware 4.0 or older.

Use 'pkgtool' to install or remove these from your system. 
These can also be installed with 'installpkg <package_name.tgz>'.                                                   

Enjoy!
