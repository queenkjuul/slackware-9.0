glibc-debug: To use these libraries, set LD_LIBRARY_PATH when calling the debugger:
glibc-debug:   LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/debug gdb <executable>
glibc-debug:
glibc-debug: Or, use this approach if you need to debug a setuid binary:
glibc-debug:   su user -c "LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/debug gdb <executable>"

PACKAGE LOCATION:  ./extra/ham/packet
PACKAGE SIZE (compressed):  44 K
PACKAGE SIZE (uncompressed):  140 K
PACKAGE DESCRIPTION:
xconvers-0.8.1-i386-2: Xconvers is a client for convers, a IRC-like conversation
xconvers-0.8.1-i386-2: system for hamradio operators. Convers differs from IRC 
xconvers-0.8.1-i386-2: because there is a much smaller command set and command 
xconvers-0.8.1-i386-2: input and output is generally shorter. This is done 
xconvers-0.8.1-i386-2: because a lot of convers servers are linked by radio 
xconvers-0.8.1-i386-2: waves, where traffic should be kept low.
