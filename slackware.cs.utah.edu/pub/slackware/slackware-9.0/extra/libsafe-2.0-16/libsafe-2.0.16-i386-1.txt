libsafe:
libsafe: The libsafe library protects a process against the exploitation of
libsafe: buffer overflow vulnerabilities in process stacks and against format
libsafe: string exploits.  Libsafe works with any existing pre-compiled
libsafe: executable and can be used transparently, even on a system-wide basis.
libsafe: The method intercepts all calls to library functions that are known to
libsafe: be vulnerable.  Libsafe has been shown to detect several known attacks
libsafe: and can potentially prevent yet unknown attacks.  Experiments indicate
libsafe: that the performance overhead of libsafe is negligible.
