This is ZipSlack split into smaller Zip files that can fit on floppy disks.
These might be useful for installing on a laptop with only a floppy disk for
input, or to make downloading a little easier.  To install, extract *all* of
the .zip files in C:\, D:\, or some other top-level DOS/Windows drive directory.
The archives will make their own C:\linux directory.

Then, just follow the usual ZipSlack directions to get it going.

Have fun! :)
