# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

lvm: lvm (Logical Volume Manager)
lvm:
lvm: Heinz Mauelshagen's LVM (Logical Volume Manager) for Linux.
lvm: LVM adds an additional layer between the physical peripherals and the
lvm: I/O interface in the 2.4.x kernel to get a logical view of disks.  
lvm: This allows the concatenation of several disks (so-called physical
lvm: volumes or PVs) to form a storage pool (so-called Volume Group or VG)
lvm: with allocation units called physical extents (called PE).  With LVM,
lvm: you can actually extend, resize, or relocate storage dynamically.
