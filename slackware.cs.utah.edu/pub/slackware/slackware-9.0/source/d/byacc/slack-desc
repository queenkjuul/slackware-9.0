# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

byacc: byacc (Berkeley Yacc parser generator)
byacc:
byacc: Berkeley Yacc is an LALR(1) parser generator.  Berkeley Yacc
byacc: has been made as compatible as possible with AT&T Yacc.  Berkeley
byacc: Yacc can accept any input specification that conforms to the AT&T
byacc: Yacc documentation.  Specifications that take advantage of
byacc: undocumented features of AT&T Yacc will probably be rejected.
byacc: If you skip this package and install GNU bison, a /usr/bin/yacc
byacc: shell script will be created which will allow you to use bison
byacc: instead. (It contains 'bison -y $*')
