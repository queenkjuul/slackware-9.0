# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

gdb: The purpose of a debugger such as GDB is to allow you to see what is
gdb: going on "inside" another program while it executes -- or what another
gdb: program was doing at the moment it crashed.  GDB can help you catch
gdb: bugs in the act.  You can use GDB to debug programs written in C, C++,
gdb: Modula-2, and Fortran 77.
