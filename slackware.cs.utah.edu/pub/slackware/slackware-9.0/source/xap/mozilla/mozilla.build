# Hehehe, well this _is_ pretty cheap, but it's
# taking the path of least resistance.  The
# mozilla tarballs always have problems that prevent
# a straightforward build, and all the sub-projects
# in GNOME build off the semi-official RPMs, so it
# makes more sense to build with most of their
# patches from a spec file than to waste time trying
# to independantly create a set of mozilla patches
# that do the same thing...
#
# I'm going unnamed here. :)
