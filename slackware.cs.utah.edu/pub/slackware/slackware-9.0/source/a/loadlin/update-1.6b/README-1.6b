LOADLIN-16b
===========

This version of LOADLIN contains a small fix to boot kernels with
GDT layouts other than the standard ones (loadlin-1.6b nevertheless
can boot also standard kernels).
Prominent example of such a non-standard GDT kernel is Win4Lin.

Thanks to Robert W. Hall <bobh@n-cantrell.demon.co.uk> for pointing
this out, having made a primary fix and testing the final binary;-)
