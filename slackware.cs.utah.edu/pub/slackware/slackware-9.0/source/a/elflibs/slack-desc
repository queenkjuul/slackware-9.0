# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

elflibs: elflibs (shared libraries needed by many programs)
elflibs:
elflibs: This is a collection of shared libraries needed to run Linux programs.
elflibs: ELF (Executable and Linking Format) is the standard Linux binary 
elflibs: format.  These libraries are gathered from other Slackware packages
elflibs: and are intended to give a fairly complete set of runtime ELF
elflibs: libraries without having to install every package these libraries come
elflibs: from.  If you're doing a full installation, these libraries are
elflibs: redundant, but installing them doesn't hurt.
