For any package that causes an update to scrollkeeper, you
should remove the /var/lib/scrollkeeper stuff from the package
(leave only the directory), and add this to the install
script:

if [ -x /usr/bin/scrollkeeper-update ]; then
  /usr/bin/scrollkeeper-update -p /var/lib/scrollkeeper 1> /dev/null 2> /dev/null
fi
