The modules package contains the modules for:

  --  the kernel
# We use the kernel pcmcia modules now.  -P
#  --  pcmcia-cs
  --  DRM (direct rendering) modules for XFree86.
      We mostly use the DRM modules included with XFree86
      (as of 4.3.0), but still use the gamma.o.gz from the
      older kernel-drm package since the driver in XFree86
      is broken.
# emu10k1 modules are updated with these CVS versions in
  order to support Audigy cards.
